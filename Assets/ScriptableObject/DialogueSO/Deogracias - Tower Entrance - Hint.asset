  messages:
  - The cursed winds howl still... yet you press on. Does resolve guide you... or
    desperation?
  - Shadows stretch long where old sins linger. Seek what was lost... if you dare
    gaze into the past.
  - Beware the twisted faces of forgotten vows. Faith, when blind, consumes both
    the faithful... and the forsaken.
  - The price of redemption is steep... and the weight of truth heavier still. Do
    you possess the strength... to bear both?
