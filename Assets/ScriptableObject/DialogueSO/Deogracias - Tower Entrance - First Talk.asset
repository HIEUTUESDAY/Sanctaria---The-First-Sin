  messages:
  - Ah... a soul stirs once more in this forsaken place. You awaken, nameless and
    burdened, yet unbroken.
  - These lands... scarred by sins long past, cursed by oaths sworn and betrayed.
    Forgotten by gods, remembered by misery.
  - You stand where countless fell... condemned to wander or perish. A fate neither
    merciful nor just, only inevitable.
  - Rise... and carve your path through guilt and atonement. Seek the truth buried
    in ashes, for redemption is earned... never given.
  - The cursed winds howl still... yet you press on. Does resolve guide you... or
    desperation?
  - Shadows stretch long where old sins linger. Seek what was lost... if you dare
    gaze into the past.
  - Beware the twisted faces of forgotten vows. Faith, when blind, consumes both
    the faithful... and the forsaken.
  - The price of redemption is steep... and the weight of truth heavier still. Do
    you possess the strength... to bear both?
