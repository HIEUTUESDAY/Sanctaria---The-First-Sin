  messages:
  - Another wanderer emerges... yet your wounds seem lighter than most. The battlefield
    spares none for long.
  - I mend the broken, though many are beyond saving. Their souls linger... their
    bodies fail... but still, I try.
  - "These hands were meant to heal, yet they\u2019ve seen more death than life.
    A cruel irony... but purpose binds me still."
  - Rest if you must, but know that salvation here is fleeting... as fragile as the
    breath of the fallen I tend to.
  - The wounded whisper of a reckoning... a tide of vengeance yet to come. Prepare,
    if your spirit endures.
  - Their battles may be over... but yours is far from done. Steel your resolve...
    before it is tested anew.
  - I stitch the flesh, but the soul... it bears scars I cannot mend. Guard yours...
    for it weakens with every loss.
  - The war never ends... not for the living, nor for the fallen. Fight... if only
    to delay the inevitable.
