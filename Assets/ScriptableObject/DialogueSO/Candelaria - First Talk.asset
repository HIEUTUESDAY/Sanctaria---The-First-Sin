  messages:
  - Ah... a wanderer with purpose... or perhaps just another lost soul seeking respite?
  - Gold and fate... both fleeting, both cruel. Yet one can still trade for the other...
    if you have the will.
  - These trinkets and relics... remnants of forgotten lives, cursed hopes, and desperate
    bargains. Perhaps they may serve you better... or doom you faster.
  - Step closer, if you dare. In this forsaken world, fortune favors only those ready
    to pay its grim price.
  - The winds carry whispers of battles fought... and debts unpaid. Care to settle
    yours?
  - Many pass through these cursed lands... few return. Their loss... your gain.
    What will you barter today?
  - Even redemption demands a price... and mercy is seldom free. Choose wisely...
    before fate chooses for you.
  - Coin, relics, memories... all can be traded, but none without cost. Make your
    offering... before the darkness claims its due.
