  messages:
  - The wounded whisper of a reckoning... a tide of vengeance yet to come. Prepare,
    if your spirit endures.
  - Their battles may be over... but yours is far from done. Steel your resolve...
    before it is tested anew.
  - I stitch the flesh, but the soul... it bears scars I cannot mend. Guard yours...
    for it weakens with every loss.
  - The war never ends... not for the living, nor for the fallen. Fight... if only
    to delay the inevitable.
