  messages:
  - The winds carry whispers of battles fought... and debts unpaid. Care to settle
    yours?
  - Many pass through these cursed lands... few return. Their loss... your gain.
    What will you barter today?
  - Even redemption demands a price... and mercy is seldom free. Choose wisely...
    before fate chooses for you.
  - Coin, relics, memories... all can be traded, but none without cost. Make your
    offering... before the darkness claims its due.
